# Flutter Foreground/Background Event Notifier

Flutter plugin to detect when app(not Flutter container) goes to background or foreground.

This is a fork of [ajinasokan/flutter_fgbg](https://github.com/ajinasokan/flutter_fgbg) with the following changes implemented:  
- the app listens on `UIApplication.willResignActiveNotification` and `UIApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification` instead of `UIApplication.didEnterBackgroundNotification` and `UIApplication.willEnterForegroundNotification` to react on cases where the app becomes inactive. This may happen for example, when the user taps the home button twice or when there is a incoming call.
- `FGBGEvents.ignoreWhile` is now asynchronous

See all changes [here](https://github.com/ajinasokan/flutter_fgbg/compare/master...code-heroes-pty-ltd:flutter_fgbg:master)

## Why

Flutter has [WidgetsBindingObserver](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/WidgetsBindingObserver-class.html) to get notified when app changes its state from active to inactive states and back. But it actually includes the state changes of the embedding Activity/ViewController as well. So if you have a plugin that opens a new activity/view controller or in iOS if you start a FaceID prompt then WidgetsBindingObserver will report as the app is inactive/resumed.

This plugin on the other hand reports the events only at app level. Since most apps need only background/foreground events this plugin is implemented with just those events. In iOS, plugin reports `didEnterBackgroundNotification` and `willEnterForegroundNotification` notifications and in Android, plugin reports these using `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-process` package.

Checkout `example/` project to see the differences in action.

## Getting Started

Add to your pubpsec:

```shell
flutter pub add flutter_fgbg
```

Use the built in Widget:

```dart
FGBGNotifier(
    onEvent: (event) {
        print(event); // FGBGType.foreground or FGBGType.background
    },
    child: ...,
)
```

Or consume the event stream directly:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_fgbg/flutter_fgbg.dart';

StreamSubscription<FGBGType> subscription;

...
// in initState
subscription = FGBGEvents.stream.listen((event) {
    print(event); // FGBGType.foreground or FGBGType.background
});

// in dispose
subscription.cancel();
```

## Caveats

In newer Android versions and `image_picker` library, picking an image will open a different app this will make Flutter app switch to background/foreground and `flutter_fgbg` will report this. At the moment there is no solution to this since the API is working as intented. Tracking the issue [here](https://github.com/ajinasokan/flutter_fgbg/issues/5).

As a work around you can use `FGBGEvents.ignoreWhile` API like this:

```dart
FGBGEvents.ignoreWhile(() async {
    await picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
    // or do something else that can put app to background but don't want to be handled by flutter_fgbg
});
```
